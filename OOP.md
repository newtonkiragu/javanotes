## Java
It is a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each others methods

### Object
objects have states and behaviours

Example: a dog has states - skin color, name, breed. It also has behaviours - tail wagging, sticking the tongue out, barking, eating

### Class
A template/blueprint that defines the behaviours that the object of its type supports

Example: the class dog can have the state and the behaviours of the dog and can be used later to create the instance of the dog

### Methods
This is basically a behaviour. A class can contain many methods, just like a dog can contain many behaviours.
Logic is usually written here, like what to happen when the dog barks. Data is manipulated, and all actions are triggered

### Instance variables
Each object has its own unique set of instance variables
An objects state is created by the values assigned to these unique variables
