## Basic Java Syntax
### Case sensitivity
Java is case sensitive
the identifier Hello and hello would be interpreted differently

### Class names
For all class names, the first letter should be in uppercase. If multiple words are used to declare the class, TitleCase should be used
Example:
```java
class MyFirstJavaClass {}
```

### Method names
All method names should start with a lowercase letter. If several words are used to declare the method, camelCase should be used
Example:
```java
public void myMethodName()
```

### Program file name
The name of the program file should exactly match the class name
Example:
Assume `MyFirstJavaProgram` is the class name, the file should be saved as `MyFirstJavaProgram.java`

### public static void main(String args[])
Java processing starts from the `main()` method which is a mandatory part of every Java program
